# Feature Specification: EVTX Viewer VS Code Extension

**Feature Branch**: `001-a-vs-code`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A VS Code extension that opens .evtx files and lets you browse, filter, search, and export Windows Event Log data‚Äîentirely offline, inside a VS Code webview."

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer or IT professional needs to analyze Windows Event Log (.evtx) files for debugging, forensic investigation, or system monitoring purposes. They want to open these files in VS Code, browse through potentially thousands of events efficiently, apply filters to focus on relevant data, examine detailed event information, and export filtered results for further analysis‚Äîall without requiring network connectivity or live system access.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer has a crash dump .evtx file, **When** they open it via "EVTX: Open File" command, **Then** they see a virtualized table with all events loaded and can filter by Provider = ".NET Runtime" and specific Event IDs
2. **Given** an IT professional has multiple .evtx files from different machines, **When** they use "EVTX: Open Folder" command, **Then** all .evtx files are merged into a single view with events sorted chronologically
3. **Given** events are displayed in the grid, **When** a user clicks on any event row, **Then** a details pane opens showing XML, JSON, and best-effort message text views
4. **Given** filters are applied to show only warning and error events, **When** the user clicks "Export to CSV", **Then** only the filtered events are exported with selected columns and metadata
5. **Given** a user is working with a large 2GB .evtx file, **When** the file is opened, **Then** events load progressively with a progress indicator and the grid remains responsive during loading

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an .evtx file is corrupted or cannot be parsed?
- How does the system handle files larger than available system memory?
- What occurs when no events match the applied filters?
- How are timezone conversions handled for events from different time zones?
- What feedback is provided when export operations take significant time?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide VS Code commands "EVTX: Open File", "EVTX: Open Folder", and "EVTX: Add File to Current View"
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse .evtx files and display events in a virtualized, sortable table with columns for TimeCreated, Level, EventID, Provider, Channel, Computer, Task/Opcode, Keywords, and message availability indicator
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide multi-select faceted filters for Level, Provider, Channel, EventID, and other metadata fields
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide free-text search capability with both simple text matching and regex pattern matching across event metadata and payload data
- **FR-005**: System MUST display timezone information and allow users to toggle between Local and UTC time display
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a details pane with three tabs: best-effort Message text, formatted XML, and formatted JSON representations of selected events
- **FR-007**: System MUST include copy-to-clipboard functionality for event details with pretty-printing and expand/collapse controls for structured data
- **FR-008**: System MUST support exporting filtered event data to CSV and JSONL formats with user-configurable column selection and delimiter options
- **FR-009**: System MUST process all data locally without requiring network connectivity or external services
- **FR-010**: System MUST show progress indicators during file parsing and loading operations
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain responsive user interface performance during large file processing through streaming parse and incremental indexing
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement virtual scrolling to handle display of large numbers of events efficiently
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide real-time record count updates as files are parsed and loaded
- **FR-014**: System MUST support cross-platform operation for archived .evtx files regardless of source operating system
- **FR-015**: System MUST implement memory management with LRU caching to prevent excessive memory consumption during large file processing

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **EVTX File**: Represents a Windows Event Log binary file, contains metadata about source system, creation time, and collection of event records
- **Event Record**: Individual log entry with structured data including timestamp, severity level, provider information, event ID, and optional message payload
- **Filter Set**: User-defined criteria for displaying subset of events, includes time range, metadata field values, and text search patterns
- **Export Result**: Formatted output of filtered events in user-specified format (CSV or JSONL) with selected columns and metadata
