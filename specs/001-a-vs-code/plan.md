# Implementation Plan: EVTX Viewer VS Code Extension

**Branch**: `001-a-vs-code` | **Date**: 2025-09-25 | **Spec**: `/Volumes/Projects/specs/001-a-vs-code/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Volumes/Projects/specs/001-a-vs-code/spec.md`

## Summary
Primary requirement: VS Code extension for viewing and analyzing Windows Event Log (.evtx) files with offline processing, virtualized display, advanced filtering, and export capabilities. Technical approach focuses on TypeScript/JavaScript for VS Code extension development with high-performance binary parsing and web-based UI components.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x + Node.js 18+ (VS Code extension runtime requirement)
**Primary Dependencies**: VS Code Extension API, binary parsing library (e.g., node-bindings for native modules), virtual scrolling library, web-based grid component
**Storage**: Local file system only (no persistent storage beyond VS Code workspace state)
**Testing**: Jest for unit tests, VS Code Extension Test Runner for integration tests
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform VS Code (Windows, macOS, Linux) with Node.js runtime
**Project Type**: VS Code extension (single project with extension + webview structure)
**Performance Goals**: >10MB/sec EVTX parsing throughput, <512MB memory usage for 2GB files, <100ms UI response time
**Constraints**: Offline-only operation, no network dependencies, memory-efficient processing of large files, cross-platform binary compatibility
**Scale/Scope**: Handle files up to 2GB, display millions of events via virtualization, support multiple concurrent file sessions

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Code Quality Standards Check:**
- [x] Linting tools specified: TypeScript ESLint, Prettier for code formatting
- [x] Documentation strategy: TSDoc for all public APIs, README with usage examples
- [x] Dependency justification: VS Code API (required), binary parser (performance), grid library (UI virtualization)
- [x] Code formatting standards: Prettier with pre-commit hooks via husky

**Test-First Development Check:**
- [x] TDD approach planned: Unit tests for parsing logic, integration tests for VS Code commands
- [x] Test coverage target ≥80% established for all core modules
- [x] Test execution automation: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with VS Code test runner
- [x] Test-before-implementation workflow: Parser tests → UI component tests → integration tests

**User Experience Consistency Check:**
- [x] Error message format: Consistent notification patterns using VS Code's notification API
- [x] Progress feedback planned: Progress bars for file parsing >2 seconds, loading indicators
- [x] UI interaction patterns: Standard VS Code webview patterns, consistent keyboard shortcuts
- [x] Accessibility requirements: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

**Performance Requirements Check:**
- [x] Specific performance targets: >10MB/sec parsing, <512MB memory, <100ms UI response
- [x] Benchmarking planned: Automated performance tests with large sample files
- [x] Performance testing strategy: Memory profiling, parsing speed tests, UI responsiveness metrics
- [x] Resource usage limits: Memory capping via LRU cache, streaming parsing for large files

**Security and Reliability Check:**
- [x] Input validation strategy: Binary format validation, sanitization of parsed data before display
- [x] Error handling: Graceful failure modes, no information leakage in error messages
- [x] Security logging: Extension activation/deactivation events, file access logging
- [x] Data cleanup strategy: Memory clearing after file processing, temporary file cleanup

**Structure Decision**: VS Code extension architecture with clear separation between extension host (Node.js) and webview (browser) contexts. Parser runs in extension host for file system access, UI components run in webview for rich interaction.
