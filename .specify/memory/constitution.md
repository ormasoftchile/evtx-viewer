# EVTX Viewer Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every module MUST maintain high code quality through automated enforcement: 
Linting with language-specific tools required for all code; Documentation MUST cover all public APIs with examples; Dependencies MUST be explicitly justified and regularly audited for security; Code MUST follow consistent formatting standards enforced via pre-commit hooks.

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)  
TDD mandatory across all features: Tests written first → User/stakeholder approval → Tests fail → Implementation; Minimum 80% code coverage required; All public APIs MUST have comprehensive test suites; Test execution MUST be automated and required for merges.

### III. User Experience Consistency
Consistent interaction patterns across all interfaces: Error messages MUST be clear, actionable, and consistently formatted; All user-facing operations MUST provide progress feedback for operations >2 seconds; UI/CLI interfaces MUST follow established design patterns; Accessibility requirements MUST be met for all user interfaces.

### IV. Performance Requirements  
Performance targets MUST be measurable and enforced: EVTX parsing speed MUST achieve >10MB/sec throughput; Memory usage MUST stay under 512MB for files up to 2GB; UI responsiveness MUST maintain <100ms response time for user interactions; Performance regressions MUST be caught via automated benchmarking.

### V. Security and Reliability
Security-first approach for all file processing operations: Input validation MUST sanitize all EVTX file data before processing; Error handling MUST prevent information leakage; Logging MUST capture security-relevant events without exposing sensitive data; Crash recovery MUST preserve user progress and prevent data corruption.

## Security Requirements

File processing security is paramount given the sensitive nature of Windows Event Logs: All file parsing MUST use safe, bounds-checked operations to prevent buffer overflows; Temporary files MUST be securely created and cleaned up; User data MUST never be transmitted outside the local system without explicit consent; Memory containing sensitive log data MUST be cleared after use.

## Development Workflow

Quality gates ensure constitutional compliance: All pull requests MUST pass automated tests, linting, and security scans; Code reviews MUST verify adherence to UX consistency and performance standards; Release branches MUST pass end-to-end performance benchmarks; Documentation updates MUST accompany all user-facing changes.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. Amendments require documented justification, stakeholder approval, and migration plan for existing code. All project decisions MUST verify compliance with these principles. Violations MUST be addressed before merge approval. Complexity additions MUST be explicitly justified against the simplicity principle.
